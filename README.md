🧠 MoodMate — Express Freely, Reflect Securely
MoodMate is a modern mood tracking and journaling application built with Vite + React for the frontend and powered by Java Spring Boot on the backend. Developed with the help of AI, MoodMate offers a safe, personal space where users can share their emotions—whether it’s joy, doubt, stress, or daily rants—without fear of judgment or exposure.

🎯 Purpose:
In a time where oversharing on social media can come with consequences, MoodMate encourages emotional expression with ethics. It gives users a private and secure outlet to process thoughts and feelings, instead of venting publicly where words can be misinterpreted or used against us later.

With MoodMate, you can:

🌈 Track your mood day by day

📝 Rant or reflect privately in a personal journal

🔐 Keep your entries safe and confidential

👥 Optionally share your moods with trusted friends

💡 Develop self-awareness through reflection, not reaction
